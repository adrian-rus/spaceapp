# spaceapp

App created for NASA's spaceapp Dublin 2016 for emobile pastoralism. The concept was a very easy to interact app that 
will help pastoralists in Sub-Saharan Africa to find safe water spots and graze. 
The app would need to use limited internet so it will have to team up with telecomunications networks to use the broadcast cell 
platform for urgent message transmitions.
The app here is a web app that would work as a mobile-friendly interface for the users. It uses Bootstrap for responsivness and Google Maps API
for user's location. The intreface is made up of 4 images that reflect rivers, lakes, fountains and graze being marked as 
safe.
